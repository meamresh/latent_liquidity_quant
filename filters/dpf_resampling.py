    """
    Soft-resampling (mixture with uniform) as described in arXiv:2302.09639 and Karkus et al. (2018), 1805.08975.
    
    Instead of sampling from the weights w, we sample from a mixture:
        q = (1 - alpha) * w + alpha * (1/N)
    
    The new weights are updated to keep the estimator unbiased:
        w_new = w / q
    
    This allows gradients to flow back to the original weights even through the 
    stochastic sampling step (which is treated as a constant during backprop).
